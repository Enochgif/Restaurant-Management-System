## Probelm Statement
The problem with the existing resturant managemnent system most of the restaurants these days are stuck with their management systems, and they fail to manage their operations effectively. This is because these systems are often not integrated from the kitchen to the dining area. Causing order blunders and delays in orders for customers.

In addition, a large number of restaurant management systems are not particularly good at data analysis. This leads to ambiguity for managers regarding customer insights and sales improvements. With the rising demand for online ordering and seamless reservations from customers, most legacy systems fail to keep up with the changing times leading to a loss of business in many restaurants.

Outdated systems are also a security concern for customer data. Restaurants are highly likely to be victim of data breaches. Old Systems Insecure: Old systems also are less secure with fears of customer information at the risk. Therefore, restaurants become easy targets for data breaches. Such issues can result in pricier goods, disappointed clientele, and profit drain.

But, in every sense of the word, we need old methodologies or new technology to work better â€” no matter where you are, what you want to do with your operation and how data can assist in making restaurants smarter.
